Raise :class:`~lahja.exceptions.NoSubscribers` exception if an event
is broadcasted or a request is made while there are no subscribers to
the specific event or request type. This is a safety check to avoid
scenarios where events or requests are never answered because developers
forgot to wire certain events or requests together.

If however, certain events or requests aren't expected to be subscribed to,
one can explicitly set ``require_subscriber`` on the
:class:`~lahja.common.BroadcastConfig` to ``False``.

This is a **BREAKING CHANGE**.
